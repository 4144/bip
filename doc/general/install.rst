Installation steps
##################

Script for install is comming but not here yet.

1. Take the ``bip`` folder and put it in the ``python`` directory in your IDA installation path.
2. Take the content of the ``install`` folder and put it in the ``plugins`` directory in your IDA installation path (necessary for using :class:`BipPlugin`).
3. Put every plugin you want to use in the plugins directory in your IDA installation path.

For windows you can just put the ``bip`` folder and the content of the ``install`` folder in the ``%APPDATA%\Hex-Rays\IDA Pro\plugins`` directory (and it will work on all your IDA installation).
